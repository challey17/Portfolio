        <p>
          My goal is to create intelligent well-designed applications that work
          at a high level and offer ease of use and accessibility. Something
          about client side, server side when I know more about server side. I
          am always eager to learn more by collaborating with a team of great
          programmers or in my own projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also a musician and artist. Being creative has always been a big
          part of my life. I write and release music on my own and also with
          others. I enjoy painting and drawing and sometimes exhibit my work.
