        <p>
          My passion is creating intelligent well-designed applications that
          work at a high level and offer ease of use and accessibility.
          Something about client side, server side when i know more about server
          side. I enjoy learning and growing as a developer and otherwise and am
          always eager to learn more by collaborating or in my own projects.

          I am a lifelong artist. I have written and recorded multiple albums
          myself and also in collaboration with other musicians. As a
          contemporary artist I sell and exhibit my work, primarily watercolor
          paintings and charcoal drawings, regularly. I have been meditating for
          10 years and have a daily practice which is very meaningful to me.
