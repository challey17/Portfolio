          My goal is to create intelligent well-designed applications that work
          at a high level and offer ease of use and accessibility. Something
          about client side, server side when I know more about server side. I
          am always eager to learn more by collaborating with a team of great
          programmers or in my own projects.

          I am a lifelong artist. I have written and recorded multiple albums as
          a songwriter and bandleader. As a contemporary artist I sell and
          exhibit my work- primarily watercolor paintings and charcoal drawings.
          I have been meditating for 10 years and have a daily practice which is
          very meaningful to me.
