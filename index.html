        <h3>ThinkTank</h3>
        <p>
          A full-stack platform for creating and studying flashcards. Users can
          create an account and save, edit or delete unlimited decks of
          flashcards. I have wanted to build an app like this ever since I used
          a similar application to learn spanish a few years ago. The
          convenience of digital flashcards and the ability to edit cards as
          needed made a huge impact on learning speed and retention. ThinkTank
          would be ideal for students but was created for anyone with a passion
          for learning.

        <h3>Shower Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          A full-stack social media platform dedicated to "shower thoughts" -
          brief, often funny and insightful observations about life. "Shower
          thoughts" is a popular hashtag across social media and also a
          dedicated subreddit. I wanted to create a social media site where data
          from the user communtity was kept anonymous and could be used with
          without creating a login/password, which is something I haven't seen
          on a social media platform. The app allows users to post shower
          thoughts as well as "like" other posts from the community. By saving a
          unique Id in the device local storage, users can access all the
          features of the site, including seeing their own archived posts
          without creating an account.

        <h3>LightHouse</h3>
        <p>
          A marine weather app, showing conditions in Tampa Bay waters. Users
          can search conditions at specific times in order to track how weather
          conditions might change through out their trip on the water. The idea
          for LightHouse developed after speaking with friends who uses weather
          apps to plan sailing trips. The common refrain was that these apps had
          a cumbersome user experience that were difficult to use and
          understand. LightHouse was built to create a simple and useful way to
          get the necessary and relevant information needed for a safe and happy
          experience on the water. This app would be ideal for sailing, surfing,
          or any watersport.
